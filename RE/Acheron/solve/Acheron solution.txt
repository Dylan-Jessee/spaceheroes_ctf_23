1. Run the code
2. The code asks for input in the form of N, E, S, or W. 
3. Open the binary in an IDA.
4. Read the chain of if statements to discover the required path
5. The path is a series of XORed values, ASCII values, and simple math equations to get N, E, S, or W
6. The solution is NENWSSEWSNENSSWEENWSNNESS
