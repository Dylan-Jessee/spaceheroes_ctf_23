# Battleboats in Space

**Written By: Tyler Zars**<br>
I love playing this game of battleship, but there's always this `Flag: 1` at the start and I don't get why... Can you help us make the right map for our game?

Run with `./battleship NUMBER_SHOTS MAP_FILE` where NUMBER_SHOTS is an integer and MAP_FILE is a .txt file. The provided mapfile has the number of rows and columns seperated by a space at the top and the map below it. The example can be run with `./battleship 200 example_map.txt`.

Good luck blasting!
