Good news everyone! We have been tasked with deciphering a secret message from a less than friendly group of aliens! We know that they use the results of the popular "Alien Wordle" game as a key for their daily encryption method, that they love old human ciphers, and we got a copy of their game in progress. The bad news is, none of us can read alienese. Can you figure out the message?
