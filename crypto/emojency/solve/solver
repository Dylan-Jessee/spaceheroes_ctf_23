Each number has a unique makeup to the number of factors it has 
and which numbers make up it's factors. Counting the number of 
times a factor appears as a factor will also provide some insight 
for the answer. For example, 1 will occur in every factor of a number, 
2 will occur in 1/2 of the factors, 3 will occur in 1/3 of the 
factors, etc. You can also reason your way through some numbers based 
on their factors. Say for example you knew a number's factors 
were 1, 2, 4, 8, and ðŸ’© you'd know that ðŸ’© represents 16. For the numbers
that are not determinable based on the factors of the number, more 
specifically large primes that don't appear in any factors until you
look at the factors of numbers n+1 bits in size. For example, 149 is an
8 bit prime where it does not appear as another number's factors 
until 258 and 447, both 9 bit numbers.

All input must be in emojis. The numbers are given to access the right menu 
and the valid bit size for option 3âƒ£. Option 2âƒ£ is a red herring due to the
ability to reason the prime numbers with the above mentioned approach.
